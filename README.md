Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing hate speech in textual data using Python. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, 
we aim to classify and evaluate text for hateful, offensive, or neutral content. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, 
and the implementation of machine learning models for classification.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle. It includes labeled examples of hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content.

Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing text to handle missing values, remove stop words, and normalize text.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and patterns in the dataset using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Feature Engineering: Extracting features from text using methods like word embeddings, and n-grams.
Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating classifiers like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
